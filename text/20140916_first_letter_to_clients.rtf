\f0\fs22 \cf2 Succor live probiotic drink is launching in November!\
\
Known for centuries in Eastern Europe as a healing drink, this beverage will soon be available to United States consumers for the first time.  We are proud and excited to bring it to you in the next few months.  We are calling it Succor. \
\

\b suc\'b7cor
\b0  noun \\
\f1 \uc0\u712 
\f0 s\uc0\u601 -k\u601 r\\: something that you do or give to help someone who is suffering or in a difficult situation\
\
What is it made from?  How does it taste?  Why is it healing and where can I buy it?\
\
We make this health-supporting tonic from beets.  Why beets?  Because you cant beat beets in nutritional value: beets are full of vitamins and antioxidants, and they provide serious anti-inflammatory and detoxification support.  Yet when you drink beet juice for these benefits, \'a0you drink a lot of sugar!  Succor has no sugar: lacto-fermentation transforms the sugar into beneficial probiotics.  Our Original flavor tastes exactly like pickled \'a0beet juice.  Succor is sour, with a pH of 3.5 (right between apples and wine).  You may add it to your smoothies, or drink it as a healthful addition to any meal or as a great tonic by itself.\
\
This live probiotic drink supports the services you receive from Simply Gorgeous.  Succor\'a0has all the vitamins of raw beets but is naturally sugar-free!  It\'92s also full of digestive enzymes.  Succor boosts health in many ways:\
\
	-Supports digestive system\
	-Strengthens bones\
	-Regulates metabolism\
	-Boosts immune system\
	-Helps balance blood sugar\
\
There are other probiotic beverages on the market--but please name one that is non-pasteurized, sugar- and lactose-free, with beneficial live probiotics.\'a0\
\
So, please pick us for your daily digestive support.  We suggest at least one glass of Succor every day because consistency is the key to healing.  Consuming live probiotic drinks daily will build an army of healing agents inside your body and health will beat weakness.  Sooner or later, energy and beauty will rise with you in the morning and stay throughout all day.  Succor will be with you for support.\
\
We plan to sell Succor on a subscription basis, and we want to give you a head\'92s up before we launch.  Our website will be live at the end of October; you will be able to subscribe at that time.  We looking forward to making a difference in your health and our goal is to keep the drinks coming.\
